Code repository for the Delivery Hero Recommendation Dataset (DHRD), which provides a diverse real-world dataset
for researchers. DHRD comprises over a million food delivery orders from three distinct cities, encompassing thousands of vendors
and an extensive range of dishes, serving a combined customer base of over a million individuals. We discuss the challenges associated
with such real-world datasets. By releasing DHRD, researchers are empowered with a valuable resource for building and evaluating
recommender systems, paving the way for advancements in this domain.

## Getting the data

The training and testing data is publicly hosted and can be [downloaded](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dCUvFVmt9xNOGgadql_O16SwtGy6e_hE?usp=sharing).
